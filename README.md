"Explain the book never split the difference"

"Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It" is a book written by former FBI hostage negotiator Chris Voss. It offers practical advice on how to effectively negotiate in various situations, including business, personal, and even high-stakes negotiations like hostage situations.

The book is based on Voss's extensive experience as a negotiator and draws on various psychological and behavioral concepts to provide a framework for successful negotiation. Some of the key ideas presented in the book include the importance of empathy, the use of tactical empathy to understand the perspective of the other party, the concept of "no" as a negotiating tool, and the use of calibrated questions to gather information and influence the other party.

Overall, the book aims to help readers develop their negotiation skills and become more effective at reaching mutually beneficial agreements in all areas of their lives.
